<p><b>Notes:</b> GameMap is currently instantiated in the topmost MapShell class and the
 MapCanvas objects acquire shallow references to the GameMap object.  Both 
 instances of MapCanvas make changes to the GameMap object in response to 
 mouse clicks and keyboard input.  The MapShell class modifies GameMap through
 the x and y plat map coordinate Text boxes.</p>
